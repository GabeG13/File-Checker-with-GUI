# File-Checker-with-GUI
This is a simple file search tool with GUI

Since this is one of my first project I wanted to keep things simple while allowing me to learn some of the basics of tkinter and python. I wanted to create something
I could use so I decided to make this simple search tool. My hope is to keep on adding to it as I get better with Python and make it more complex. 

I welcome any ideas on how to make this simple starter project better!

Thanks, 
Gabe
